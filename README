photo-enhancer:
==============

gThumb is a nice image viewer available in GNU/Linux.
It has an option to enhance the images.

We have to open images one by one and enhance it.

I wanted to automate this process for enhancing all the images in a folder.

How to automate the GUI operations?
There comes the LDTP. 
Linux Desktop Testing Project  http://ldtp.freedesktop.org

It has python interface to automate all our desktop operations.

Required Software:

Ubuntu 12.04 and above
ldtp
python-ldtp


To get any help in LDTP,
connect to their irc channel #ldtp in freenode.net for any queries.
